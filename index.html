Let's load the assets we need for our game. You do this by putting calls to the Phaser Loader inside of a Scene function called preload. 

This will load in 5 assets: 4 images and a sprite sheet. It may appear obvious to some of you, but I would like to point out the first parameter, also known as the asset key (i.e. 'sky', 'bomb'). This string is a link to the loaded asset and is what you'll use in your code when creating Game Objects. You're free to use any valid JavaScript string as the key.

The idea is this: When you collect all the stars the first time it will release a bouncing bomb. The bomb will just randomly bounce around the level and if you collide with it, you die. All of the stars will respawn so you can collect them again, and if you do, it will release another bomb. This will give the player a challenge: get as high a score as possible without dying.

The first thing we need is a Group for the bombs and a couple of Colliders:

<!-- Conclusion
You have now learned how to create a sprite with physics properties, to control its motion and to make it interact with other objects in a small game world. There are lots more things you can do to enhance this. Why not expand the size of the level and allow the camera to scroll? Maybe add in different baddie types, different value pick-ups, or give the player a health bar.

Or for a non-violent style game you could make it a speed-run and simply challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible.

With the help of what you have learned in this tutorial and the hundreds of examples available to you, you should now have a solid foundation for a future project. But as always if you have questions, need advice or want to share what you've been working on then feel free to ask for help in the Phaser forum.
